My assignment for week 5 day 5 

1. What is TensorFlow, and what are its key features?

TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google for deep learning and numerical computation.

Key Features:

Flexible Architecture: Supports both deep learning and traditional machine learning.

Hardware Acceleration: Runs efficiently on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs.

Dataflow Graphs: Uses computational graphs to optimize model execution.

TensorBoard: Provides powerful visualization tools for model performance.

Keras Integration: Comes with Keras API for easy model building.

Production & Deployment: Supports deployment on mobile, web, and cloud platforms.

2. What is the main difference between TensorFlow and PyTorch in terms of computation graphs?

TensorFlow uses static computation graphs (define the graph first, then execute).

PyTorch uses dynamic computation graphs (graph is built on-the-fly during execution).


This makes PyTorch more intuitive for research and debugging, while TensorFlow is optimized for large-scale production.


---

3. What is Keras, and on which frameworks can it run?

Keras is a high-level deep learning API designed for simplicity and ease of use.

Supported Frameworks:

TensorFlow (default backend)

Theano (older versions)

Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) (deprecated)



---

4. What are the key features of Scikit-learn?

Scikit-learn is a popular Python library for traditional machine learning.

Key Features:

Supervised Learning: Supports classification (SVM, Decision Trees) & regression (Linear Regression).

Unsupervised Learning: Includes clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction (PCA).

Model Evaluation: Provides tools like cross-validation and metrics (accuracy, precision).

Feature Engineering: Includes preprocessing, feature selection, and transformation.

5. What is the purpose of Jupyter Notebooks, and what are its key features?

Jupyter Notebooks is an interactive coding environment used for data science, ML, and AI.

Key Features:

Supports multiple languages (Python, R, Julia).

Live code execution with markdown documentation.

Rich visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

Easy sharing as .ipynb files or HTML.

Interactive widgets for dynamic input/output.

6. In the TensorFlow example provided, what is the purpose of the Dropout layer in the neural network?

The Dropout layer helps prevent overfitting by randomly dropping a fraction of neurons during training. This forces the model to learn more generalizable patterns.


---

7. What is the role of the optimizer in the PyTorch example, and which optimizer is used?

The optimizer updates model weights to minimize the loss function.

The most commonly used optimizer in PyTorch is Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) because it combines momentum and adaptive learning rates for efficient training.



---

8. In the Keras example, what is the purpose of the Conv2D layer?

The Conv2D layer is used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction from images. It detects patterns such as edges,textures and shapes 

9. What type of model is used in the Scikit-learn example, and what dataset is it applied to?

Model Type: Likely a classification model (e.g., Decision Tree, SVM).

Dataset: Commonly applied to datasets like Iris, Digits, or Breast Cancer.



---

10. What is the output of the Jupyter Notebook example, and which library is used to generate the visualization?

Output: Likely a graph or chart.

Visualization Library: Usually Matplotlib or Seaborn is used to create the plot.
